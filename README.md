# Seam-Carving

Seam carving is an image resizing technique that resizes the image pixel by pixel. A seam is a path of pixels from top to bottom or left to right of a picture. Unlike standard resizing techniques such as cropping and scaling, seam carving preserves the most intersting parts of the image. 

For this project I created a program that resizes an arbritary sized image using the seam carbing technique.
